## Brainstorming
###
List of possible programs:  Map distance tracker, calender, passionWorkplace, video game, calculator, website, meal exchanges,
degree, meeting place finder. In case of any need for google maps: https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-java. We chose the meeting place finder

## The Engineering Design Process

### Identify Problem
  We are looking for a way to help students at OU looking to study and collaborate; family members trying to meet up; company teams
trying to meet for brunch. This problem would be solved by developing a software application that would take the location of a couple
different groups or people and find a desired location approximately center of everyone. People can change the desired location settings
by changing variables like willingness to drive, time vs distance, method of travel, etc.

### Identify Contraints
  We have to finish this project by the 2nd of December. We have to follow all laws of copyright, etc. We also have to limit the amount of
space we have to present. The project has to follow all coding guidelines and work on the operating system of the computer it runs on. It
must also deal with any errors and logical inconsistincies.

### Generate Solutions
  Java, JavaX for the GUI applications, Google maps API (https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-java), Take the number of
people that there are as input, it can take the maximum travel distance/time of each person, method of travel, the location of each person,
and the preferred places to meet (for example: restaurant, library, museum, etc.), and outputs a google map picture and the adress of the
meeting place. We could have a website and allow each person to enter their own location. We could also pull up google maps itself with the
location selected. We could have it select an open restaurant.
